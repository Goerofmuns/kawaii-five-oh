# Kawaiify

This is a simple script to automatically switch themes on OSX.
A theme in this case is a wallpaper, terminal theme, dark or
light menu bar, etc. It is currently a heavy WIP.

![demo](script-demo.gif)

## Current Options
* Wallpaper
* iTerm2 Profile
* Hide Menu bar
* Dark or light mode
* Neofetch image

## Potential Options
* better theme storage (perhaps dedicated file?)
* KWM/KHD border colours and window settings
* better iterm2 profile switching and support for other terminals
* better argument parsing / more arguments
* better bar hiding (currently janky)
* software checks and auto setup

## Use
Right now the script needs some modifications to work on another system.
I'm working on getting it to auto-infer system properties.
