# Kawaii Five-Oh

This is a simple script to automatically switch themes on OSX.
A theme in this case is a wallpaper, terminal theme, dark or
light menu bar, etc. It is currently a heavy WIP.

## Current Options
* Wallpaper
* iTerm2 Profile
* Hide Menu bar
* Dark or light mode
* Neofetch image

## Use
Right now the script needs some modifications to work on another system.
I'm working on getting it to auto-infer system properties.
